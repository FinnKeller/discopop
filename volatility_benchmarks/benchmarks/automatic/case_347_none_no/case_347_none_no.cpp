// ==========================================================
// Case 347 - Volatility split 1: no volatility
//   Source (read) : stable  - a plain read
//   Sink   (write): stable  - an assignment through a three hop pointer chain
// Idea:
//   The observed dependency runs from one fixed write instruction to
//   one fixed read instruction over a function local static scalar.
//   The write is an assignment through a three hop pointer chain and
//   the read is a plain read. Added noise: a random branch that only
//   ever touches an unrelated scratch variable. Nothing in the program
//   can make a different instruction take either end of the
//   dependency, so the reported dependency structure cannot depend on
//   which accesses a sampling window happens to catch.
// Expected result:
//   STABLE for every WRITE_SAMPLE_BATCH. Both endpoints are single
//   instructions, so the union of observed dependencies is the same
//   with and without sampling.
